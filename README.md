# LEMON-TART RECIPE !
## ***INGREDIENTS*** 

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter

1/4 cup sugar

1 cup white whole wheat (or all purpose) flour

1/4 tsp fine sea salt (omit if using salted butter)

1/2 tsp vanilla extract

1 cup lemon curd (recipe below)

##  FOR THE LEMON CURD

1 tablespoon lemon zest

3/4 cup fresh lemon juice

1/2 cup sugar

1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt (omit if using salted butter)

3 large eggs + 4 large egg yolks

4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cubed

## ***INSTRUCTIONS***

In a stand mixer, cream together butter and sugar. Mix in vanilla. Add flour, and salt and mix well. Refrigerate dough for 30 min.

Preheat oven to 300° F. Remove dough from refrigerator and press into mini tart pans. Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until lightly golden.

Remove from oven and let cool before removing tarts from pans.

Fill each cooled tart crust with lemon curd. Top with berries or whipped cream (optional).

To make lemon curd:

Whisk eggs and egg yolks very well in a bowl. Set aside.

In a small saucepan, heat lemon zest, juice, sugar and salt over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Turn off heat. Slowly scoop a about 1/2 cup into the eggs while whisking.

Pour egg mixture into the pan on the stove while whisking to prevent curdling. Turn heat back on to low and cook, whisking, until mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in the cubed butter until it’s completely mixed in.

At this point you can strain the zest out and any egg solids that may be in the curd if you’d like, by pushing it through a fine mesh stainer, or just leave it as is.

Cover lemon curd and chill until ready to use.


DONE & EAT!
